# Workout-Routine-App

## Description

Fitness web app designed to help users create workouts, track progress and stay motivated. Given a homepage with cards with body parts, the user may click the train button and be navigated to the workout generator portion of the app. Here the user may select one of the muscle body parts and get a random selection of 8 workout cards using that body part. Each workout card gives the user the name of the exercise, the target muscle of that workout, and the equpment necessary to do it. Each card in the workouts container has a save button which can be used to save that exercise to local storage. The user may then open the favorites container to view any workouts they have saved in the past in order to view the customized created workout. They are then able to clear the saved workouts from the favorites container by clicking the clear saved workouts button. When the user is ready to track progress made from workouts, they can navigate to back to the homepage and click the "track your progress" link which will take them to a fitness calculator. The user can then enter their age, weight in pounds, height, gender, activity level and weight goal and hit the calculate button to retrieve information about their current level of fitness. The results will show the users BMI, calorie intake and a general assessment of their health. If the user ever feels their motivation lacking, they can navigate back to the home page and click the "quick read" link. The user will then be presented with a few inspirational quotes and can navigate to different parts of the fitness app from here by clicking on their represented buttons.
